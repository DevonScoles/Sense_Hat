Pi_station. Pi_station is a play on words for the hugely known console PlayStation. The concept of Pi_station is to teach young kids or primary school student's how to recognize patters using a joystick. When ran using a raspberry pi and sense hat the LEDS display a rolling text slow enough for a young student to read. Then the 1st level begins. It displays a pattern of arrows after which the player is tasked with pushing the joystick in the same pattern. If the player fails any input for the pattern the current level restarts. It's quite simple but gets harder when the level goes from wanting 4 directional inputs to 6 directional inputs.
